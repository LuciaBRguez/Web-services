### Web-services

This project satisfies
the need for transportation and accommodation for people who are going to visit a city. 
To satisfy this need, two services have been proposed, one for flights and other for hotels, which are consumed by a web client and by an application client. 
The web client is intended for travelers and the application client for the administrator of both services, both provided by the same company.

* Web client: _clientehotelfinal_
* SOAP service: _servidorhotel_
* REST service: _servicioRestVuelo_
* Web client (application): _clienteaplicacion_
